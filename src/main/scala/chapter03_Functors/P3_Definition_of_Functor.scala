     * Functor Laws
     * Functors guarantee the same semantics whether we sequence many
     * small operations one by one, or combine them into a larger func?on
     * before mapping . To ensure this is the case the following laws must hold:
     * Identity: calling map with the identity function is the same as doing noth-
     * ing:
     * fa.map(a => a) == fa
     * Composition: mapping with two functions f and g is the same as map-
     * ping with f and then mapping with g :
     * fa.map(g(f(_))) == fa.map(f).map(g
